    m_Localized: "Mount Everest (also Tib. Qomolangma, Nep. Sagarm\u0101th\u0101,
      Lim. Chajamlungma, Chinese Zhumulangma, Eng. Mount Chomolungma), is the highest
      mountain on Earth and the highest point on the Earth's continental crust, as
      measured by the height of the topographic peak of 8,848 meters above sea level
      . The mountain, which is part of the Himalayan chain in Asia, is located on
      the border between the Sagarmatha Zone in Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region
      in China.\n\nIn 1856, the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India was the first
      to establish and publish the height of Mount Everest, then known as Peak XV,
      at 29,002 ft (8,840 m). In 1865, the British Royal Geographical Society (Royal
      Geographical Society) assigned the mountain an official English name at the
      suggestion of Andrew Waugh, then the Surveyor General of India. The name Chomolungma
      had been in widespread use among Tibetans for centuries, but Waugh could not
      suggest a widespread local name because Nepal and Tibet were then closed to
      foreigners.\n\nThe highest mountain in the world attracts climbers of all profiles,
      from experienced mountaineers to beginners who are ready to pay considerable
      sums to professional mountain guides for a successful ascent. The mountain,
      although it does not pose significant technical difficulties during the ascent
      on the standard route (other peaks above 8000 m such as K2 or Nanga Parbat
      are much more difficult), still hides many dangers, such as altitude sickness,
      weather and wind. By the end of the 2008 climbing season, 2,700 people had
      made 4,102 ascents to the summit.[1] Climbers are a significant source of tourism
      income in Nepal, whose government requires all would-be climbers to issue an
      expensive permit, costing up to $25,000 per person.[2] Everest has claimed
      210 lives so far, including eight who died in 1996 during a high-altitude storm.
      In the \"death zone\" the conditions are so difficult that many bodies of the
      dead are left in place. Some of them are visible from the standard climbing
      routes.[3]"
